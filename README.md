## Native debugging

1. Install LLDB from SDK Tools in Android-studio.

2. In Android-studio go to Run->Edit Configurations->Debugger.

3. Select 'Dual' or 'Native' and add the path to linphone-sdk debug libraries (build/libs-debug/ for example).

4. Open native file and put your breakpoint on it.

5. Make sure you are using the debug AAR in the app/build.gradle script and not the release one (to have faster builds by default the release AAR is used even for debug APK flavor).

6. Debug app.

# Building the app

If you have Android Studio, simply open the project, wait for the gradle synchronization and then build/install the app.
It will download the bluezone library from our Maven repository as an AAR file so you don't have to build anything yourself.

If you don't have Android Studio, you can build and install the app using gradle:
```
./gradlew assembleDebug
```
will compile the APK file (assembleRelease to instead if you want to build a release package), and then
```
./gradlew installDebug
```
to install the generated APK in the previous step (use installRelease instead if you built a release package).

APK files are stored within ```./app/build/outputs/apk/debug/``` and ```./app/build/outputs/apk/release/``` directories.
